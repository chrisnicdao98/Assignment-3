Best Github tutorial used: The assignment instructions along with the instructions on the website worked really well. I also bookmarked the commands for unix incase I'm working on elvis linked here https://gist.github.com/deitrick/2942432

Tool Used: The github website

Using github has been pretty straight forward. As someone who's been using RCS, this works a bit better considering I'm able to access the files pretty much anywhere.
